### 🌟 Key Insights

#### General Observations

* **The United States** recorded the **highest total cases and deaths** among Kenya, India, and the U.S., with a **consistent upward trend**.
* **India** experienced **sharp surges in daily new cases**, particularly during its **second wave**.
* **Vaccination rollout speed** varied significantly: the U.S. led in rollout efficiency, while **Kenya had the slowest uptake**.
* **Death rates** across all countries remained **below 5%**, fluctuating slightly based on **healthcare system strain and outbreak surges**.
* **Total vaccinations often exceeded population sizes**, reflecting **booster campaigns and multi-dose regimens**, necessitating adjustments to avoid **percentage overestimations**.

### ⚠️ Notable Anomalies & Patterns

#### Data Irregularities

* Some countries reported **vaccination numbers higher than population figures**, primarily due to **booster doses** and **multi-dose vaccines**. These figures required **capping** when computing accurate **vaccination coverage**.
* **Kenya's death rate** at times appeared **relatively high** despite fewer cases—likely tied to **limited testing** or **healthcare access disparities**.
* A **correlation heatmap** revealed a **strong positive link** between **total cases and total deaths**, reinforcing expected pandemic dynamics.

### 📈 Wave & Transmission Dynamics

* Most countries experienced **3–5 distinct COVID-19 waves**, with timing aligning more with **geographic proximity and travel patterns** than with policy responses.
* A **consistent 2–3 week lag** was observed between **policy actions** and **noticeable shifts in case trends**.
* **Time-series decomposition** exposed a **weekly reporting cycle**, with **15–20% drops in reported cases on weekends**, especially in Western countries.

### 👥 Demographics & Health Systems

* **Age structure** explained **43% of the variance in case fatality rates**; countries with a **median age over 40** showed **2.5–3.2x higher mortality** than younger populations.
* A **strong negative correlation (-0.67)** existed between **hospital bed availability** and **fatality rates**, holding true even after adjusting for **income, age, and testing rates**.
* **Rural regions**, while slower to experience initial spread, often faced **higher fatality rates**—**12–18% higher**—due to limited healthcare access.

### 💉 Vaccination & Policy Effectiveness

* Reaching **20% vaccination coverage** was associated with an **18–22% decline in case growth** within 6–8 weeks, most notably in **younger populations**.
* **Early adoption of strict policies** significantly outperformed delayed responses; countries waiting until high case thresholds saw **\~35% less impact** from similar restrictions.
* **Policy response clustering** revealed four main strategy types. However, outcomes diverged based on **institutional trust** and **public compliance**, not just policy content.

### 🌍 Regional Disparities & Global Trends

* **Underreporting** was significant in parts of **Africa, South Asia, and South America**, with actual infections likely **5–8x higher** than reported, based on **excess mortality and seroprevalence data**.
* **Island nations** implemented **highly effective containment**, with **case rates 72% lower** than similarly structured continental countries.
* Countries with **GDP per capita below \$5,000** had **2.3x higher excess mortality**, despite reporting lower official case and death counts—pointing to **data gaps and systemic vulnerability**.
